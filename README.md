# TRAFFIC-LIGHT-CONTROL-SYSTEM-WITH-BUTTONS
This project is a Traffic Light Control System with Buttons, designed and simulated using Tinkercad and Arduino UNO. The system controls three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) to mimic a real-world traffic signal. It also includes push buttons to manually change the light sequence or simulate special scenarios (e.g., pedestrian crossing).
